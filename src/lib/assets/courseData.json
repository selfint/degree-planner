The project gives the student experience in \"real-world\" software development, the use of modern development tools and environments, while fielding typical issues arising  in the development process. The software is to be delivered accompanied by suitable documentation and a summary report.",

Related concepts, such as machine learning and neural networks, are also becoming widespread. AI algorithms stand at the heart of far reaching technological breakthroughs and hold great promises, but at the same time raise concerns about the possible rise of a destructive force driven by superintelligence. But what does artificial intelligence mean? What are the sources of the idea that one could artificially produce or create an intelligence? And what are the implications of this idea on human society? The course will run in the historical axis from Turing’s test for machine thinking articulated in the 50’s to recent debates. We will converse with chatbots ourselves, analyze anthropomorphism and empathy towards robots, relate the primordial desire to overcome nature to current debates on granting “human rights” to digital entities, ask about the economic and cultural implications of automation, and of the different ways biases migrate from the human to the digital realm. And most importantly we will ask - in what way does this change the way we conceive humanity.\n",

  "about": "“From Here to There\": Exploring the Precursors of Modern Mechanics through Texts on the Medieval Concept of Motion. \n\nModern science is credited with having developed a 'new science of motion' (Galileo). In our seminar, we will both challenge and support this conviction by analyzing translated original medieval texts about motion. We will begin by focusing on the concept of motion (Sessions 1-2). Session 3 will explore the medieval treatment of motion in terms of space and time, which we will connect in the following session (Session 4) to the geometrical representation of qualities and motions (the 'doctrine of configurations'). In Sessions 5 to 10, we will focus on various problems in Aristotelian dynamics, analyzing causality, the role of the medium, and resistance. This will include discussions of the impetus theory as applied to projectile motion, the acceleration of falling bodies, and the possibility of motion in an empty space. During the final two sessions, we will examine special cases that are both fascinating and characteristic of the late Middle Ages: the debates on the Earth's rotation (Session 11), and a unique chapter on angelology (Session 12). Here, we will explor",
