{"code":"00360109","about":" The course is designed to provide students with fundamental principles in the design of electronic systems for biomedical applications. It offers a comprehensive overview, beginning with an in-depth introduction to the physics underlying ultra-low-power electronic components, such as subthreshold transistors, memory devices, basic logic circuits, system dynamics, timing, and noise phenomena in electronic circuits and their impact on system performance. The course then focuses on the design and optimization of energy-efficient electronic components essential for biomedical instrumentation. Topics include low-power measurement amplifiers with an emphasis on stability, potentiostats with a focus on closed-loop systems, data converters, and bio-inspired electronics.  Learning Outcomes: At the end of the course the students will be able to: •\tApply various techniques to design low-power amplifiers, including analyzing noise through spectral density functions and evaluating stability using root locus methods •\tUtilize CAD tools to design and build bio-electronic circuits, including working with Cadence to perform functionality testing, Monte Carlo simulations, corner analysis, and layou","points":3,"name":"נושאים: מבוא לחומרים לא מסודרים","connections":{"dependencies":[["00340035","00340058","00340053"]],"adjacent":[],"exclusive":[]},"seasons":["Winter","Spring","Summer"],"faculty":"הפקולטה להנדסת מכונות","current":false}
