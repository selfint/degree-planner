{"code":"00360110","about":" This course focuses on the fluid mechanics of non-Newtonian liquids. The topics covered: review of Newtonian fluid mechanics; key non-Newtonian phenomena: viscoelasticity, viscoplasticity, shear thinning, shear thickening, yield stress, normal stress differences, relaxation time, extensional thickening; material functions for non-Newtonian fluids: steady and start-up simple shear and extensional flows; fundamental conservation laws that govern non-Newtonian flows and non-dimensional numbers; linear viscoelasticity;  fluid mechanics of rheometry; elementary constitutive equations and their use in non-Newtonian fluid mechanics: generalized Newtonian models, nonlinear viscoelastic models, viscoplastic models; channel flows of complex fluids; free-surface flows of non-Newtonian fluids; microstructure, conformation and elastic dumbbell model for dilute polymers; non-isothermal non-Newtonian flows; experimental demonstrations, for example, rod-climbing Weissenberg effect, shear thinning, shear thickening, extensional thickening.     \nLearning Outcomes: \t By the end of this course, the students will be able to: \n• Use the terminology of non-Newtonian fluid mechanics and have a common   l","points":3,"name":"מכניקת זורמים לא ניוטוניים","connections":{"dependencies":[["01040228","00340013"],["00340055","01040228"]],"adjacent":[],"exclusive":[]},"seasons":["Winter","Spring","Summer"],"faculty":"הפקולטה להנדסת מכונות","current":false}
