{"code":"00480351","about":"  The course shall review medical signals and their origins (eg. electrical and mechanical activity of the heart, electrical activity of the brain, and optical reflections from beating arteries), types of sensors for acquisition, common challenges in recording of bodily signals, selection of appropriate signal processing and analysis methods, and using the acquired knowledge in a mini-project in medical signal processing using medical data acquired with digital health equipment at VISL lab and/or public bio-signal databases.     Learning Outcomes: \t At the end of the course the students will be able to:  - Familiarized with principles and concepts of Digital Medical Electronics (DME). - Identify and apply appropriate signal processing methods for common DME topics. - Experience in DME mini-research, presentation, and writing a short scientific paper. - Understanding in DME towards conducting independent research in the field.","points":2,"name":"עיבוד אותות ברפואה דיגיטלית","connections":{"dependencies":[["00440198"]],"adjacent":[],"exclusive":[]},"seasons":["Winter","Spring","Summer"],"faculty":"הפקולטה להנדסת חשמל ומחשבים","current":false}
