{"code":"00560409","about":" This course covers the fundamentals and applications of smart drug delivery systems. Introduction to controlled drug delivery: History, basic principles, advantages/disadvantages, limitations, smart drug delivery systems motivation and current state-of-the-art. Smart drug delivery systems: Nano-based systems, Stimuli-responsive systems, Targeted-systems, Carrier-free systems, Cellular-based systems, and Theranostic systems. Smart drug delivery systems engineering: Smart components/chemistries (phase transition), Stimuli /suitable smart DDSs (pH, Redox, Molecule-responsiveness systems, bio-responsive, light, temperature, magnetic, ultrasound, others). Smart drug delivery systems characterization: Chemical (composition and functionality), Physical (size, morphology and distribution), and Thermal analysis. Implants as Smart drug delivery systems: advances and actively moving polymers. Systems validation and monitoring models: Imaging, in vitro & in vivo (including pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic )PK/PD( modeling). Smart drug delivery systems applications for various indications and clinical status. Smart drug delivery systems projects discussion.
