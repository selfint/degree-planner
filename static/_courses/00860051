{"code":"00860051","about":" Calculus of variations, Hamilton’s principle, and classical theory of plates. Plates with shallow curvature. Modelling constraints using Lagrange’s multipliers. Unsteady linear potential flow aerodynamics and cavity acoustics in response to flexible wall motion. Flutter, divergence, and buckling of elastic plates.    Learning Outcomes: \t After completing the course students will be able to: 1.\tDerive equations of motions and boundary conditions of thin-shell structures using variational methods. 2.\tAnalyze problems that include interaction between elastic plates, freestream flow, and acoustic pressure in terms of stability (flutter, divergence, and buckling) and transient response. 3.\tImplement Ritz methods to obtain numerical solutions and perform stability and transient analyses in generalized coordinates.","points":3,"name":"הידוד זורם-מבנה בטבלות","connections":{"dependencies":[["00840515","00840312","00840225"]],"adjacent":[],"exclusive":[]},"seasons":["Winter","Spring","Summer"],"faculty":"הפקולטה להנדסת אווירונוטיקה וחלל","current":false}
