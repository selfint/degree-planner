{"code":"00960267","median":96,"about":" This course will teach the the principles of secure programming in common programming languages. During the course, weaknesses taken from well-known sources in the literature, such as the OWASP Top 10 Vulnerabilities list, will be discussed in depth, and the appropriate protective measures to deal with these weaknesses will be discussed. The course will deal with the analysis and recovery of weaknesses from open source libraries, taken from well-known databases such as the National Vulnerability Database, and demonstrations of weaknesses and attacks will be carried out using code snippets. Students will learn the guidelines for secure code from recognized standards in the software world, such as the SEI CERT Coding Standards. In addition, they will learn how to write code that locates potential weaknesses in existing code, using a language such as CodeQL to write queries and find bugs and weaknesses.    Learning Outcomes: At the end of the course the students will be able to: 1. Implement defenses against vulnerabilities in their code. 2. Find and identify vulnerabilities in existing code that they did not necessarily write. 3. Report vulnerabilities they have discovered themselve","points":3,"name":"מבוא לתכנות מאובטח","connections":{"dependencies":[["02340117","00940210"],["00940210","00940704"]],"adjacent":[],"exclusive":[]},"seasons":["Winter","Spring","Summer"],"faculty":"הפקולטה למדעי הנתונים וההחלטות","current":true}
