{"code":"06180061","about":"the course focuses on how to transition from legacy energy delivery infrastructures dependent on fossil fuel to a sustainable decarbonized grid that harnesses distributed renewable energy resources and responsive demand from buildings! electrified transportation systems! and industrial loads. the content includes models and abstractions for the architecture of the cyber-physical energy system! its economics! and future evolution! and numerical optimization and learning methods in support of the infrastructure's safety critical operations in the legacy system and in the future architecture. \r\n_learning outcomes: at the end of the course the students will  know:\r\n 1.  to understand and be able to implement mmodels for demand! supply and transfer of electricity characterizing energy infrastructures.\r\n 2. to understand how tthe legacy system: energy markets work.\r\n 3. to be able to explore tthe designdesigns opportunities for new architecture! inference! decision! and market models that exist! leveraging advances in digital technology to improve emissions. 4. to understand and be able to implement aadvanced numerical methods","points":3,"name":"מער. עירוניות ומער. אספקת אנרגיה","connections":{"dependencies":[],"adjacent":[],"exclusive":[]},"seasons":["Spring"],"faculty":"מדע יישומי (ג'ייקובס-קורנל)","current":false}
